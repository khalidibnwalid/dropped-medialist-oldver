# MediaList
 # Dropped Beacuse it was Not Well Planned:
1. It was my first project, eventhough it is not that bad, But I was ignorent when I started it,
2. Every time I see the code and some errors (mostly image related one) I become too lazy to continue working on it
3. Having 3 hosts (client: next js, server: express js, db: postgress) is an overkill for such a light app
4. Manythings I installed a library for didn't actully need it and were easy to implement (such as drag and drop, and Masonry).
5. Bad naming

# Future Plans:
1. Full refactor,
2. using next js APIs instead of backend
3. using sqlite instead of postgres (eventhought I hate sqlite)
4. remaking a lot of its functionlity
5. will keep the original look
6. will try to make it more flexible
