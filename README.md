# MediaList
 # Dropped Because it was Not Well Planned:
1. It was my first project, and even though it is not that bad, I was ignorant when I started it,
2. Every time I see the code and some errors (mostly image-related ones) I become too lazy to continue working on it
3. Having 3 hosts (client: next js, server: express js, db: Postgres) is an overkill for such a light app
4. Many things I installed a library for didn't actually need it and were easy to implement (such as drag and drop, and Masonry).
5. Bad naming

# Future Plans:
1. Full refactor,
2. using next js APIs instead of dedicated backend
3. using SQLite instead of Postgres (even though I hate sqlite)
4. remaking a lot of its functionality
5. will keep the original look (for most pages at least)
6. will try to make it more flexible (i.e supporting custom layouts and widgets)
